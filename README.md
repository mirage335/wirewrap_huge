Wirewrap tool, 3D printer friendly and configurable to support large posts and wire diameters.

# Usage

May be used to wrap wire on large posts used for some connections by 3D Printer 'motherboards', or to wrap thin diameter solder around bare twisted wires to be soldered together.



# Design

Edit with FreeCAD.


# Safety

Professional wirewrap tools are designed to ensure a large amount of pressure between wire and post corners. This tool does not. This tool is only intended for occasional use as an alternative to professional wirewrap tools in unusual situations.

Some care will be needed to ensure adequately reliable and low-resistance connections.

Soldering may carry some risks, particularly from lead (if not 'lead-free'), or various flux compounds. For wire splicing with heat shrink to mitigate tin wiskers, it is possible, but unproven, that lead-free solder may be adequate.
